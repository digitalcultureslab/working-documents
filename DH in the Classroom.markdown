Talk given at the Douglas College PD Day Events
August 31, 2015

+ Presentation - how do you traditionally have students "present" their work? 
+ Mapping - how do we practice "mind-mapping" / how might the physical world work for us? (go outside!)
+ Projects - no useless assignments (think about improving the world, not impoverishing it)
	+ better map labelling
	+ letters arguing for curriculum
	+ assistance for future students
+ Open - open source materials to make libraries or knowledge repositories to be accessed by others
	+ open bibliographies
	+ open texts
	+ get students to engage with self-reflective exercises on open practice
+ Neutrality - accept that there are things that you teach that are politically charged. How closed are you?
+ Relevance - have a cellphone policy? Why not have an assignment where students forcefully and reasonedly argue for or against cell phone use in the classroom. If one of them is good, open the classroom -- not about being relevant; it's about showing how their work can instigate change. 
+ Let students into your practice... how can they understand what you do?
