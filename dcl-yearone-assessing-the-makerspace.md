**Assessing the Maker Lab, Maker Space, Hacker Lab, Digital Cultures Lab**

We're a year in; it was a year ago today that we opened a space where people could use 3D printers and play with other forms of technology. It's been an interesting year with more valleys than peaks, but one that we've learned a  lot from. We got lots of great press, met some really interesting and engaged people, and kept a few students employed doing fun stuff. And, if those are our key takeaways, that's a successful venture.  

**What's in a Name?**

As you can be told from the title above, one of the first issues we had with the space was what to call it. As you can see from the photo below, the space is pretty small--just over 300 square feet all in. It's also a fishbowl, but more on that in a moment. Point is, it was never going to be a Maker Space in the sense that most conversations imagine such a space to be; it was simply too small, lacked adequate ventilation, and was ill-equipped for the demands of a true Maker Space. 

That said, we didn't really give the name much thought. We had been looking at bigger spaces and our motivation was to start a Maker Space and so that was the name we gave it in all our dialogue about the space and what eventually everyone started calling it. In hindsight, calling it a Maker Space as we did in the beginning was a mistake. It set expectations way over what we actually had and sent us on planning missions the execution of which was well beyond our means. The key takeaway here was that we really should have thought about the name more and called it a "hackerspace" or something esoteric and opaque: "digital cultures lab." Doing so would probably have meant less press and hindered our ability to capitalize on a wave of discussions about Maker Spaces, but it would have made it much easier to manage expectations. 

At the same time, the name set us on a course I'm not sure we should have been on. The name hurt us because it made us think beyond the capacity of the space. The result was a series of failures and half-starts to say nothing of that sinking feeling where a potential partner might feel that you've wasted their time. All this to say that the name is important for these spaces because it guides expectations both inside and outside the space itself. Not only are others using that name as a signal for a set of expectations, but the team responsible for the space is using that name to guide their activities, actions, and outcomes. 

**Location, Location, Location**

We were so incredibly fortunate to be given our space--a purpose built, brand new space--by the [New Westminster (British Columbia) River Market](http://rivermarket.ca/). I can't imagine doing this venture with anyone more gracious, patient, and helpful than the folks who run the River Market. That said, the distance between the space and the College (about 5 city blocks and over a railway bridge) has been hard to "bridge."

**What We'd Say to Others**

THIS NEEDS ONE OF THOSE ARROW DOCUMENTS LIKE BRENNA MAKES

- Define your outcomes early and *change* them as the project gets running; work hard to keep your expectations in-line with your achievements. 
	- Does the space actually allow for what you want to do? If not, what does it allow for? Do you want to do that?
