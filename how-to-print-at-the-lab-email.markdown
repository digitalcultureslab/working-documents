Hi,

Thanks for your interest in the Douglas College Maker Lab. This Email will give you a few details that you'll need if you would like to access the space or have something printed. 

**First things first:** we will only printed *original* 3D created objects. We will not reproduce objects found on [Thingiverse](https://www.thingiverse.com/) or other exchange-based sites. You need to have made the object yourself in order to qualify to have it printed in the Lab. The **only** exception to this rule: if the object you wish to have printed has a pedagogical purpose and can be used in the classroom as a teaching aid, we will consider printing it on a case-by-case basis after examining the justification. 

**Process:** If you have have a file you wish to have printed, all you need to do is Email it to us at [this address](mailto:research@douglascollege.ca), include a valid Douglas College student number in the Email, and allow two weeks for us to print the object (it'll probably be faster than that, but no guarantees). We will acknowledge receipt of the file by Email and be in touch when the print has begun (so you can come watch if you want) and if there are any potential issues with the file itself.

**The File:** All files must be in [.stl (stereolithography) format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)). If we receive a file in any other format, we will not be able to print it. Software such as [autodesk123](http://www.123dapp.com/) and [AutoCAD](http://www.autodesk.com/products/autocad/overview) can be used to build these files. Some Adobe products will export in .stl format, depending on the license. Unfortunately, the Lab has no expertise to access for help building these files, yet. 

**Some Quick Tips:** This is an emerging technology, so there's lots of issues and potential hiccups--lower your expectations for what's possible and keep the following in mind:

- **The fewer micro-details, the better.** If your object has a lot of tiny details on it, chances are it will not print to your expectations. If you are desperate to print details, try to separate them out from the main object and add them on later rather than pre-attaching them as part of the rendered 3D object.
- **Keep the export file under 5MB in size.** Anything larger than that is bound to fail and take forever to print. A 5MB file, depending on the level of detail takes about 6 hours to print. 
-   **You're not going to get it perfect on the first try.** Your object will probably underwhelm the first time you see it. But, we'll talk about what worked and didn't with you and then you can go back and make it better and we'll print it out again. Iterations are part of the process of developing a successful print--think long-term success, not quick-hit trinket. 

Ok, that's it for now. We hope the Maker Lab will provide you with the opportunity to do something awesome. 

Cheers,
MakerLab Staff
